# Dice and Dungeons

This project is a roguelike game with procedurally generated content. It was created for my engineering work.
Level generation was implemented by my module, which can be found at this [link](https://github.com/SzymonRogozinski/DungeonGenerator).

## Game description

Dice and Dungeons is a roguelike dungeon crawler game with procedurally generated content. You play as a party of adventurers seeking treasure in the lowest level of the dungeon. The dungeon is filled with enemies and chests full of loot. Combat is based on rolling a pool of dice; each action has its own dice. Items, levels, and enemies are generated by an algorithm.
